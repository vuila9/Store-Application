This project requires JavaFX so if you dont have it set up, downloading this codes and run would simply dont work.

Here is step by steps to have it set up before you can run this.

First and foremost, I am using IntelliJ IDEA as my main platform for java, I have not tried other platform like Eclipse or Microsoft VC
so this instruction might not work for them.
The OS I am using is Windows 10 Pro.

So, let us begin:

Again, I am using IntelliJ IDEA as my platform, free version works just fine. Be sure to update it to the latest version.

- First of all, go to this website: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/, and download the latest version of Java SDK (as of this time, it's 15.0.1)
- Extract the zip file, you will have a folder named like this: "javafx-sdk-15.0."
  + Move the file to a location that is convenient for you, in my case, I put it directly inside where I install my IntelliJ: C:\Program Files\JetBrains\

- Open IntelliJ, click on File, go to Setting, click on "Path Variables", click on the little "+" on botton left corner to add a path
  + You should name it as: PATH_TO_FX (or whatever name that is clear, because you will use it later)  
  + After that, in the "value" section, you will browse to the folder you move previously "javafx-sdk-15.0.", you open it and select the folder called "lib"
  + You should have something like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62405278/109595017-b7835580-7ae1-11eb-9482-420d953b80c6.png)

 
- Now, you will copy all the source files in my repo, notice if you are organizing it into a package, be sure to include the line "package name" on top of every source files.
- Then, you will locate the at this position, click on it and select "Edit Configuration" ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62405278/109594796-67a48e80-7ae1-11eb-811d-167ea7ff266a.png)
